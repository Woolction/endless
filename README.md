Endless is an open-source distributed video hosting platform focused on high-performance and fairness for content creators and viewers, providing an easy environment for building an audience and privacy for all users of this platform. [Learn more about Endless.](https://github.com/Woolction/endless/wiki)

### Why Endless?

YouTube has become a corporate monolith focused on advertising and data collection. Endless was created to make it easy for viewers to watch what they love and for content creators to grow. Endless is built on transparency, fairness, and performance.

- **Community-Led Evolution:** Endless is open to the world. Any developer can contribute to the core, and every user has a voice in reporting issues or suggesting changes: [Learn more about Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Radical Transparency** ([The Endless Wiki](https://github.com/zynres/endless/wiki)): No "black box" algorithms. Our Wikipedia-style documentation allows anyone to see how our systems work-from Vector Embeddings to ranking logic.


### Core Infrastructure

Endless is engineered for high availability and low latency, utilizing a modern distributed stack:

*   **Asynchronous Video Processing:** Leveraging FFmpeg and RabbitMQ to handle multi-resolution encoding (HLS/m3u8) without blocking the main API.
*   **Hybrid Data Layer:** High-performance data access using Dapper for read-heavy operations and Entity Framework Core for complex domain logic.
*   **Recommendation:** A personalized video ranking system based on vector similarity using custom Preference Engine
*   **Searching:** Advanced content filtering and users/channels discovery using Elasticsearch (edge-ngram, ngram).
*   **Real-time Engagement:** Instant notifications and live interactions powered by SignalR.
